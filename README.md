# Decision Mathematics Solver
This Repo contains the final files for the decision mathematics solver I produced for a third party client, as part of the A Level Computer Science Course.
This program was the prototype version, which was intended to be expanded upon to also show the working in solving the user's problems, so that it could be used as a learning tool for students as well as a way of checking results.
